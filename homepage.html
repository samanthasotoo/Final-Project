That day, there was a police dispatch that there was a black male that "keeps pulling a gun out of his pants and pointing it at people". However, the caller made sure to report that the pistol "was probably fake" in the beginning and at the end of the ca; while a;sp saying "he is probably a juvenile". This important information was not relayed to the two police officers Timothy Loehmann (26 years) and Frank Garmack (46 years). When the officers arrived on the scene, they repeatdly yelled "show me your hands" from their car. Loehman claimed that instea of Rice showing his hands ot the officer it "appeared" like he was ttrying to draw the toy gun, however Loegman claimed that at the time: "I knew it was a gun and I knew it was coming out". So, the officer shot Rice twice hitting him once in the Torso. The next day in the hospital, Tamrir Rice a 12 year-old bot who was playing outside with his toy gun like every other kid was deemed a criminal because of his skin color and killed.

<div id="Gang Violence" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>Gang Violence</h2>
<h3>  <p>Individuals living in communities where violence is heavily present are often in fear of their lives. As a result, many tend to carry a weapon as a form of protection. Unfortunately, this can increase the level of aggression if an altercation were to commence. Carrying a weapon adds fuel to the fire instead of stabilizing peace and preventing violent actions. Although individuals feel like they are protecting themselves and their family, many others can view it as a threat, a threat that needs to be eliminated.</p></h3>
 <p><h3>People who have suffered from altercations with a gang are not just victims but are people. Research has shown that these individuals tend to suffer from PTSD(post traumatic stress disorder); this makes them more likely to suffer from depression.Depression can vary in different forms. An individual may have develop of feeling of self loathing from an assault due to gang violence or feeling nothingness, they become part of a cycle; lost with no motivation to improve their situation. Someone who lost a family to gang violence may be deprived of love and go searching for acceptance. If they decide to join a gang, they become part of a cycle that they were once a victim of.</p></h3>
